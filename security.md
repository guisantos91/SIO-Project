# Server Key Management

1. **Authentication Key Pair**:
   - A static key pair (public/private) used only for authentication, not for encrypting sessions.
   - This pair is long-lived and allows the client to verify the server's identity. The serverâ€™s public authentication key can be shared with clients and does not change often.

2. **Ephemeral Session Key Pair**:
   - A new key pair (public/private) generated for each session to ensure forward secrecy.
   - This pair is short-lived, used specifically for encrypting a single session. It changes with each session, meaning each session has a unique shared key that cannot be reused.
   - Once the session is complete, this ephemeral key pair is discarded.
